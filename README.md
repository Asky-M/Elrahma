XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a text-based markup language
derived from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)

XML tags identify the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather 
than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to 
display the data.

<h4>7.2. Characteristics of XML</h4>
<li>XML is extensible: XML allows you to create your own self-descriptive
tags, or language, that suits your application.</li>
<li>XML carries the data, does not present it: XML allows you to store
the data irrespective of how it will be presented.</li>
<li>XML is a public standard: XML was developed by an organization 
called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is available as 
an open standard.</li>

<h4>7.5. XML Syntax Rules</h4>
<li> All XML Elements Must Have a Closing Tag.</li>
<li> XML Tags are Case Sensitive.</li>
<li> XML Elements Must be Properly Nested.</li>
<li> XML Documents Must Have a Root Element.</li>
<li> XML Attribute Value Must be Quoted.</li>
